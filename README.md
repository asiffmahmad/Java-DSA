# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains a clean and structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**.  
The goal is to maintain all core DSA concepts in one place with clean code, explanations, and modular structure — ideal for interview preparation and strengthening problem-solving skills.
